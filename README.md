# Dynamic PON Configuration Dataset

This repository contains an open dataset collected from our experimental study on dynamic configuration of Passive Optical Networks (PON). The dataset captures detailed measurements under varying traffic conditions and T-CONT configurations.

## Dataset Overview

~~The dataset is available for download [here]()~~  
The dataset will be made available upon publication of the corresponding paper, in order to ensure proper referencing and context.

Each dataset (ZIP file) corresponds to a specific 24-hour traffic pattern. Currently, six datasets are available (and the collection is growing), each featuring a distinct traffic behavior. These datasets include:

- **2.43â€¯GB** of CSV-formatted data  
- Outputs from a **traffic generator** and associated **network parameters**  
- **Network configurations** and **user traffic profiles** recorded at **12-minute intervals** over a 24-hour emulated period  
- **Performance results** for every combination of configuration and traffic profile, featuring **88 metrics per direction** (uplink and downlink), such as:
  - Latency  
  - Frame loss ratio  
  - Bit error rate  
  - Throughput  
  - Packet size  
- **Traffic patterns** derived from both **real-world studies** [1,2,3] and **synthetic scenarios**, applied to diverse network configurations  
- Data stored in **multi-indexed Pandas DataFrames** to enable structured and efficient analysis


## Experimental Setup

![Diagram](imgs/infrastructure_photograph.png)

The dataset was collected in a controlled laboratory environment, simulating a GPON network with the following components:

- OLT (Optical Line Terminal)
- 16 ONUs (Optical Network Units)
- Traffic generator
- Ethernet switches
- Server
- SDN controller

## Use Cases

This dataset can be used for:
1. Analyzing GPON performance under diverse traffic conditions
2. Training ML models for network configuration prediction
3. Testing dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms
4. Benchmarking PON solutions in research
5. Studying QoS management in shared optical infrastructure

Thank you for your interest in our dataset! We hope it serves as a valuable resource for your research and development efforts in the field of PON optimization and network performance analysis. This dataset is continuously growing. New configurations and measurements will be added over time.
